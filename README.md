A simple project to plot animated hearts for Valentine's Day. Or any day
you want to show your love.

The heart shape graphs come from math equations. The script generates points
for the equations with SymPy or NumPy and plots the points with Matplotlib.

Valentine's Day, also called Saint Valentine's Day or the Feast of Saint
Valentine, is celebrated annually on February 14 in many regions of the world.

## Can I use `matplotlove` being single?

Sure. And here is a song for you:

```
Lonely people - America

This is for all the lonely people
Thinking that life has passed them by
Don't give up
Until you drink from the silver cup
And ride that highway in the sky

This is for all the single people
Thinking that love has left them dry
Don't give up
Until you drink from the silver cup
You never know until you try

Well, I'm on my way
Yes, I'm back to stay
Well, I'm on my way back home

This is for all the lonely people
Thinking that life has passed them by
Don't give up
Until you drink from the silver cup
She'll never take you down or
Never give you up
You'll never know until you try
```
